    "- Demonstrate approach and pipeline\n",
    "- Provide a reproducible example for technical reviewers\n",
    "- Highlight business impact where appropriate\n",

    "# MILP Supply-Chain Examples — Comprehensive Notebook\n",

    "This notebook brings together:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Basic MILP models: Greenfield facility location, Brownfield + CAPEX, Sourcing with MOQs.\n",
    "- Extensions: Multi-commodity flows, Inventory with lead time & service level requirements.\n",
    "- Benders decomposition implemented using Gurobi callbacks (master + LP subproblem loop).\n",
    "- Mock AWS integration examples (mock S3, Parameter Store, Batch) and real `boto3` snippets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each model has a **mathematical explanation** (LaTeX) followed by a **code cell** (Pyomo). The Benders section demonstrates an iterative Pyomo implementation that uses Gurobi as the solver for both master and subproblem. Replace mock AWS classes with real `boto3` calls in production.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This notebook contains runnable code cells. It expects `pyomo` and a solver (Gurobi recommended). If Gurobi is not available, change solver names to `glpk`/`cbc` where appropriate.\n"
